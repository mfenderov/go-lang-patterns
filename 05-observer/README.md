# Observer Pattern

## What is the Observer Pattern?

The **Observer Pattern** is a behavioral design pattern that defines a one-to-many dependency between objects. When one
object (the **subject**) changes its state, all its dependent objects (the **observers**) are automatically notified and
updated. This pattern is commonly used to implement event-driven architectures.

## Why Do We Need the Observer Pattern?

The Observer Pattern is useful in scenarios where multiple objects need to be informed about changes to the state of
another object. This approach ensures **loose coupling** between the subject and its observers, promoting scalability
and flexibility.

### Key Benefits:

- **Decoupling:** The subject does not need to know the details of its observers, only that they implement the observer
  interface.
- **Scalability:** New observers can be added without modifying the subject.
- **Reusability:** The subject and observers can be reused independently in other contexts.

## Common Use Cases

- **Event Listeners:** UI frameworks where components listen for user actions.
- **Real-Time Updates:** Social media notifications, stock price updates, or weather apps.
- **Publisher-Subscriber Systems:** Messaging systems where publishers notify subscribers of new messages.
- **Game Development:** Notifying players of game state changes, like score updates.
