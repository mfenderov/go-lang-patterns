# Adapter Pattern

The **Adapter Pattern** is a structural design pattern that enables objects with incompatible interfaces to work
together.
It acts as a bridge, wrapping one interface and converting it into another that a client expects.

## Why Use the Adapter Pattern?

1. **Interface Compatibility**: Allows two incompatible interfaces to communicate without altering existing code.
2. **Reusability**: Integrates third-party libraries or legacy systems into new applications.
3. **Flexibility**: Decouples code, making future changes or replacements easier.
4. **Maintenance**: Keeps your system clean and organized by encapsulating the adaptation logic.

## When to Use the Adapter Pattern

- **Integration**: When you need to use an existing functionality or library that doesn't match your applicationâ€™s
  interface.
- **Legacy Support**: When working with legacy code that needs to fit into a modern interface.
- **Third-Party Libraries**: When incorporating external libraries without modifying their code.
- **Multiple Interface Support**: When you need a single system to interact with multiple subsystems, each with its own
  interface.

## Benefits

1. **Decouples Systems**: Reduces direct dependency on incompatible components.
2. **Improved Flexibility**: Changes are confined to the adapter, minimizing the impact on the rest of the code.
3. **Increased Reusability**: Encourages the use of existing components in new systems.
4. **Seamless Integration**: Simplifies working with third-party libraries or legacy systems.

## Common Use Cases

1. **API Integration**: Wrapping a third-party API to conform to your application's interface.
2. **Legacy System Migration**: Adapting legacy code to work with modern systems.
3. **Hardware Abstraction**: Bridging different hardware drivers to a unified interface.
4. **Cross-Language Compatibility**: Adapting components written in different programming languages.
