# Observer Pattern

## What is the Observer Pattern?
The **Observer Pattern** is a behavioral design pattern that defines a one-to-many dependency between objects. When one object (the **subject**) changes its state, all its dependent objects (the **observers**) are automatically notified and updated. This pattern is commonly used to implement event-driven architectures.

## Why Do We Need the Observer Pattern?
The Observer Pattern is useful in scenarios where multiple objects need to be informed about changes to the state of another object. This approach ensures **loose coupling** between the subject and its observers, promoting scalability and flexibility.

### Key Benefits:
- **Decoupling:** The subject does not need to know the details of its observers, only that they implement the observer interface.
- **Scalability:** New observers can be added without modifying the subject.
- **Reusability:** The subject and observers can be reused independently in other contexts.

## Common Use Cases
- **Event Listeners:** UI frameworks where components listen for user actions.
- **Real-Time Updates:** Social media notifications, stock price updates, or weather apps.
- **Publisher-Subscriber Systems:** Messaging systems where publishers notify subscribers of new messages.
- **Game Development:** Notifying players of game state changes, like score updates.

## Example Use Case: Social Media Notifications
In a social media app, influencers (subjects) notify their followers (observers) whenever they post something new. Each follower can react independently to the notification without blocking others. This ensures that updates are scalable and efficient.

### Without Observer Pattern:
The influencer would need to maintain direct references to all followers and manually notify them, making the system tightly coupled and harder to maintain.

### With Observer Pattern:
The influencer maintains a list of observers and notifies them through a standardized interface. This makes it easier to add, remove, or modify followers without affecting the influencer's core functionality.
